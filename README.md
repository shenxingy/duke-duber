# Duke-Duber
Duke Duber is a Django-based ride-sharing web app for the Duke community. Users can register as drivers to offer rides or as riders to request/share rides, reducing COâ‚‚ emissions and traffic. Riders earn Green Coins (Chlorophyll) to support reforestation in Duke Forest, helping sustain wildlife and replace aging trees.
